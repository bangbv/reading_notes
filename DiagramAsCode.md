# DiagramAsCode

Would it be nice if the code we wrote automatically turned into architecture diagrams?

I recently discovered a Github repo that does exactly this: Diagram as Code for prototyping cloud system architectures.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐨?

- Draw the cloud system architecture in Python code.
- Diagrams can also be rendered directly inside the Jupyter Notebooks.
- No design tools are needed. 
- Supports the following providers: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, etc.
